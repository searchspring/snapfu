# Snapfu

**snap Â· fu** - _"the way of snap"_

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/snapfu"><img alt="NPM Status" src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/snapfu.svg?style=flat"></a>

Snapfu is the scaffolding command line tool for the Searchspring Snap SDK. This tool creates a new Searchspring project from one of our existing Snap scaffolds and bootstraps a development environment. These scaffolds include a Github action that when triggered will build and deploy Snap bundles to our infrastructure (permissions required).

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g snapfu
```

## Login

Login to access your Github organizations - the following command will open a browser window
to give snapfu access to your Github organizations and to be able to create repositories in subsequent steps.

```bash
snapfu login
```

## Init

Create your website with the init command. Init will gather some information about the kind
of Snap project you wish to create. You will need your `siteId` and `secretKey` from the SMC before you run this command. This command will:

-   download scaffolding files
-   create and initialize a repository in the Github organization you selected
-   populate a Github secret with the provided `secretKey`

```bash
snapfu init my-awesome-website
```

## Run it

Now you can run the project with your standard `npm` tooling.

```bash
cd my-awesome-website
npm install
npm run dev
```

See the `package.json` for other npm commands.

## Deployment

This tool integrates with the Searchspring build and deploy process. In order to take advantage of this you must select searchspring-implementations as your organizaiton during init.

The tool uses Github actions to copy files to our AWS S3 backed CDN (Cloudfront).

When you commit to the main branch (production), the github action will deploy all the files that build into `./dist` to a publicly readable S3 bucket which can be accessed at the following URLs:

```
https://snapui.searchspring.io/<siteId>/bundle.js
https://snapui.searchspring.io/<siteId>/production/bundle.js
```

Similarly, if you push a branch to github called `my-branch` that will be available at

```
https://snapui.searchspring.io/<siteId>/my-branch/bundle.js
```

## Deploying to other places

You can modify the file `deploy.yml` in your generated project under `my-awesome-website/.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
to complete different actions if you don't want to use the Searchspring build process or don't have access to it.
